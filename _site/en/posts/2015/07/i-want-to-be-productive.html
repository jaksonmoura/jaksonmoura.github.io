								<p>Productivity is generally related to time, it's one of the first things that comes to our minds. Time is the most important resource we have in our lives, also the most unorganized.</p>

<h2>Time without focus achieves nothing.</h2>

<p>I've always wanted to have more time to make stuff. Well, actually, until three months ago, I had plent of time, so much time that I didn't know what to do with it. I spent my days, when not working, playing games and whatching videos about it (what a waste, huh?).</p>

<p>Fortunately, I started feeling weird and useless for not building stuff people would use and benefit from it. I felt I could be much more than that.</p>

<p>I've decided to begin focusing on learning, creating, design and building my projects. Back then, my job didn't have much to offer, I had to switch jobs, and so I did. Now I work on different projects that can help people directly and indirectly.</p>

<p>After the job, at night I want to spend time with my fiancee and my little yorkshire. Which would get "all night". But sometimes, not to say most of them, I just use the time for me and and led my folks down.  I was supposed to figure that out.</p>

<p>Recently I was listening to Late nights with <a href="http://www.travandlos.com/13">Trav and Los podcast</a> episode about increasing creative output by 150%, in it I was introduced to Polyphasic sleep, a method as soon as I heard I became interested in. I can split the time at night with my fiancée properly and have time for me. I've started doing Polyphasic sleep this July 1st. You can see my sleep schedule below.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/productive-2.png" alt="My schedule by napchart.com" />
My schedule by napchart.com</p>

<p>With this little time that I've implemented the polyphasic sleep method I came across a little problem, that I'm willing to solve: Time management.</p>

<p>I plan to share my experience on polyphasic sleep a bit more in the future. Right now, there's a thing that a can share with you that I learned by doing it:</p>

<h2>If you don't have focus, this extra time you got, is useless.</h2>

<p>I say that because at night after I wake up from the core sleep, at 2:30 am, if I don't have defined agenda I fell more sleepy.</p>

<p>Now I'm learning AngularJS and bug fixing my old projects, as well as rebuilding one in particular (that I'll talk about in another post) using a list to kind of maintain a daily rhythm for what to do, even thought it's flexible.</p>

<p>So before you think you don't have time, look first on how you spend it.</p>
